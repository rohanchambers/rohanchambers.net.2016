Bower
When intsalling bower packages use -save (This makes it a dependency)
eg. bower install bourbon --save

Update bower packages
eg. bower bourbon update
all packages: bower update


Grunt
npm install creates package.json
npm install grunt-contrib-uglify --save-dev

*NB Grunt Watch task should always be the last in the registerTalk call. 
To update other tasks on watch i.e. cssmin or combine, on watch add them to the tasks list

BrowserSync sometimes needs to be removed from registered tasks and connect needs to run alone. Then bring sync back in.

Added a .gitignore for all Gruntâ€™s node_modules and .sass-cache
