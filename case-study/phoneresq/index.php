            <p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
            <p>Phone ResQ. is a privately owned business that repairs and improves all handheld devices and home computers. They needed a complete identity rebrand and a fresh rebuild of their site.</p>
            <p>I took on the project as a designer, developer and project manager. I was working directly with the owner and other members of staff to complete all tasks from proposing color scheme ideas to the intial design proposal and presentation to final deployment on their servers. The site had to be fully responsive on all major mobiles, tablets and computers so a lot of cross browser testing was done.</p>
            <p>I was fortunate to get this project through a connection of an old high school friend from Switzerland, Geneva, Deryck Burnett owner of Megabite computer services in Fernandina beach, Florida.</p>
