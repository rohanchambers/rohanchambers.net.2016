					<li>
						<p>This project required me and work colleague Mark Barlow to build and develop an interactive CD-Rom. The project idea was left totally up to us but we knew we wanted the project to have a certain style, look and feel. The name of the project was called 'Stalker' and was based upon the cinematographer Tarkovsky and his movie "Stalker'.</p>					
						<p>All the navigation and some components of the project were photographs taken from real objects and edited in Photoshop and then imported into Director.</p>
