							<div class="content">
								<h3>Stage 1:</h3>
								<p>Understanding the <span class="fontColor">scope</span> of the project. Discuss as much as possible with the client the <span class="fontColor">goals of the project</span>. Clearly 
								define the purposes for the website. What demographic are they trying to <span class="fontColor">target</span>. Choice of color scheme to represent the 				
								companies look and feel. Overview of possible <span class="fontColor">technologies</span> used such as CMS, wordpress, video, image galleries, flash etc...</p>					
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<h3>Stage 2:</h3>
								<p>Design <span class="fontColor">mock ups</span> for possible layouts of the website which is then sent and reviewed by client. Constructively take 
								on board <span class="fontColor">feedback</span> from client and make amends where necessary, all the while giving <span class="fontColor">guidance and ideas</span>. This process will tend to occur 					
								many times and layouts will be sent back and forth until the client is completely satisfied with one. Get client <span class="fontColor">approval</span> for final design 					
								layout.</p>

								<h3>Stage 3:</h3> 
								<p>Commencement of site development. <span class="fontColor">Hand coding</span> of the website with the use of XHTML and CSS all the while fulfilling 					
								web standards (<span class="fontColor">W3C</span>) and <span class="fontColor">accessibility</span> requirements. Search engine Optimisation best practices are carried out to get the best search results 					
								possible. Testing for  <span class="fontColor">cross browser</span> compatibility. All dynamic coding such as php, javascript, Ajax and databases is carried out if necessary. If requested by the 					
								client the <span class="fontColor">integration</span> of a CMS is built in order to give clients the <span class="fontColor">flexibility</span> to update and maintan their <br />sites content.</p>		
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<h3>Stage 4:</h3> 
								<p>Upon <span class="fontColor">completion</span> of the project and when the site has been uploaded to the world wide web I always offer maintenance and 	
								<span class="fontColor">support</span>. I also allow clients to be able to view their sites <span class="fontColor">click through rate</span> and performance with easy to read accurate 			
								<span class="fontColor">stats</span> through either <span class="fontColor">Google Analytics</span> or other web trackers.</p>
